## Abstract
Social integration can affect an individual’s susceptibility to infectious disease. Conversely, infectious disease can reduce an individual’s social activity. Yet, it remains unclear to what extent short-term infections can inhibit aspects of social integration and the formation of new relationships. During a previous study on relationship formation, we captured 21 female common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from different wild populations and housed them together in captivity. Upon introduction, we observed an unplanned outbreak of bacterial infections that caused cutaneous lesions. After treating infected bats with an antibiotic, 5 bats recovered, but 4 others suffered lasting injuries. We analyzed how allogrooming rates changed over time among familiar and new dyads consisting of the 9 infected and 12 asymptomatic bats. We found that infected bats demonstrated reduced activity and social behavior, that more severely infected bats gave and received less allogrooming compared to asymptomatic bats, that the effect of infection was larger for new dyads relative to familiar dyads, and that this effect decreased as infected bats recovered and new dyads became more familiar. These opportunistic observations were consistent with the hypothesis that short-term infections can impact relationship formation when new individuals join a group.
